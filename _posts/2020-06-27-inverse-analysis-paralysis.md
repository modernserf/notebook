title: Inverse Analysis Paralysis

There are a lot of parallels between the systemic dysfunction in my last job and my own personal dysfunction, and given what _my_ symptoms were all pointing towards, I've been referring to this as "institutional ADHD." One particular symptom I encounter in both contexts is the notion that there is an enormous amount of work that needs to be done, but there is somehow also "nothing to do". This is usually framed as "[analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)" -- you can't choose what to work on next.

I think when people hear analysis paralysis, they think of [Buridan's Ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan's_ass): there are too many good options, and analyzing each option re-prioritizes it to the top. But what I have experienced far more often is the opposite of this: upon evaluation, _none_ of the options seem worthwhile. In this case, the number of options is basically irrelevant. And instead of being trapped in a state of indecision, you decide very quickly -- to do nothing.

This looks something like:
- What should I do today?
- Maybe I should clean the kitchen.
- Hmm, my pantry is pretty disorganized.
- I should get some, like, shelves or something.
- Should I order something from the container store?
- This seems like a lot of money, and I don't even have a job right now.
- I guess my kitchen is fine the way it is. Well, let's see what's happened on Twitter in the last five minutes.
