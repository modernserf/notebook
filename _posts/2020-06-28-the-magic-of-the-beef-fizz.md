Last week, this curious concoction was circulating Twitter:

I've been making a lot of unusual drinks lately (though nothing quite as unusual as this) so I figured I'd give it a shot. Lots of foods that I love (e.g. beer, cheese, honey) do not seem like they would be tasty when you describe the process to make them; maybe the same is true of the beef fizz? 

My guess is that this drink is a family-friendly derivative of the [Bullshot](https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-the-bullshot-cocktail-is-no-joke), a briefly trendy cocktail in the Bloody Mary tradition, and in my version I added the booze back to it (in this case, using tequila instead of vodka for a little more personality). 

I took a sip of this and didn't die, but it was surprisingly bland. I realized this was probably because I was using real beef stock and not Campbells, which is condensed & has a bunch of added seasonings. I ended up taking it in a slightly phá»Ÿ-influenced direction: inspired by the [Gin-Gin Mule](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/gin-gin-mule/) I added muddled mint & basil. After some more tweaks I added more flavors: instead of the Bullshot's tabasco & worcestershire, I used sriracha and fish sauce.

In the end it was ... fine? I described it to my partner as "about as good as a Bloody Mary at a wedding" -- I probably wouldn't make it for myself again, but I might try it if it were on a menu. I still suspect it would be better with a condensed broth base -- I think much like coffee, it does not handle dilution well.

But when I was making this drink, I had a sort of epiphany about these drinks and their presence in 70s dinner party cookbooks -- I think they are more fun to serve to other people than to drink yourself. The magic of this drink isn't that it's _good_, exactly, but that it's way better than it sounds, and serving it to your guests is like performing a magic trick.
