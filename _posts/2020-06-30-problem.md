As I was scrolling through the timeline this morning, I got annoyed with a series of tweets on the topic of mandatory ethics classes in computer science. While I believe that ethics are a fundamental part of understanding the role of one's profession in society, I doubt that ethics classes would have much impact on the behavior in industry. I thought today I would write about how ethics is a problem with _businesses_ much more than it is a problem with _engineers_, and the ethical standards for """"real"""" engineers are only meaningful because violating them has actual, legal consequences for both engineer and employer.

But instead I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/modernserf/status/1277941446587428865?s=21) about it instead, because I wanted people to actually read it.
