In the absence of real work, my [conversation pit](http://justinfalcone.com/notebook/2020/06/26/levels.html) project has become my primary creative outlet. I'm still figuring out the specifics, but I think the back half of the room will be a king-sized bed on a very low platform, and the front half of the room will have floor-level couches & side tables on a thickly-padded rug. 

I'm still trying to figure out the overall aesthetic; my apartment doesn't currently have any intentional color themes or aesthetics beyond "IKEA Modern", but this project is a basically ground-up redesign of the room, so I have an opportunity to make a Statement with this. 

But as I've been talking my friends ears off about this project, a few have pointed out the irony in building a conversation pit when I rarely had guests over before, and I _certainly_ won't be having guests over anytime soon. But the way I see it, I'm a "reverse prepper" -- in the midst of the apocalypse, I'm planning for a recovery, or a new beginning.
